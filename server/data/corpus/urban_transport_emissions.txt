Urban transportation systems are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Mode shift from private vehicles to public transit, cycling, and walking reduces per-capita emissions while improving air quality and congestion. Electrification of buses and light-duty vehicles can further decarbonize mobility when paired with clean electricity. Pricing instruments and street design influence behavior, but equity considerations are essential for durable policy. Measuring impacts requires harmonized data on ridership, fuel use, and land-use patterns.
