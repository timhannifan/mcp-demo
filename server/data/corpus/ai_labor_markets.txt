Advances in artificial intelligence affect labor markets through task substitution, augmentation, and productivity changes. Occupations with high exposure to language-based tasks may see rapid transformation as generative models scale. Historical evidence suggests technology can both displace some workers and create new roles; impacts depend on policy, training, and the reorganization of work. Complementary skills—problem-solving, data literacy, and communication—gain value when automation expands. Measured at the firm level, adoption correlates with output growth but heterogeneous effects on employment.
