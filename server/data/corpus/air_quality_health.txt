Air quality and public health are closely linked. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with increased risk of respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. Children and older adults are particularly vulnerable due to developing or compromised respiratory systems. Interventions such as emissions controls and clean-fuel transitions can reduce PM2.5 concentrations and improve population health outcomes. Short-term exposure spikes can trigger asthma exacerbations and emergency visits, while long-term exposure contributes to chronic disease burden.
